## Reflection Prompts
10.	How did AI tools shape your design or coding decisions? 
AI accelerated the decision-making process throughout the project. It helped quickly compare potential design patterns, identify cleaner architectures, and it automatically used best practies that we used in had learned in class so we didn't even need to think about remembering to add it. Instead, we could just look back and confirm that it had included everything we need.

11.	What did you learn about verifying and improving AI-generated outputs? 
We learned that AI outputs should never be used for a final product. We tired to do a oneshot just to see how far it would get us, but it was no where near what we wanted for our final product. What worked really well for imporving the output AI gave us was providing clearer constraints, edge cases, or examples. The process of refinement decreased with time as we figured out exactly we wanted and didn't want. 
12.	What ethical or managerial considerations emerged from using AI in your project?
The ethical considerations that arose from using AI during this project were the accuracy risk, the risk of bias, and transparency risks. Managerial considerations for this assignment were that we were not doing enough in the process, letting AI take the reigns. We made sure that we did not do this by reviewing individually what AI had produced to endsure that there were no hidden bugs.
13.	How might these tools change the role of a business technologist or product manager in the next five years?
Their role will completely move from writing code to orchestrating Agents wrting code. The humans jobs will include describing the problem, requirements, edge cases, and constraint as well as working on how the application will look and interact with the customer. 

# Dev Notes & AI Interactions

## Creating Wireframe
- Tool: Figma Make
- Prompt summary: I gave Figma Make the Executive Summary, Core Features, and recommended database schema from the project brief.
- Outcome: Figma Make generated a wireframe that included all major features and some scaffold code. I iterated on it a few times to make design tweaks and include minor features that were initially omitted, such as profile pictures. I then exported the wireframe as a PDF and downloaded the prototype code to use as context for Cursor.

## Creating the ERD diagram
-Tool: Eraser.io
-Prompt summary: I input the recommended relational schema into eraser.io to generate the ERD diagram
-Outcome: The results included an ERD containing all the entities along with the attributes as well as the data types. While I had never seen the data types be included in ERD's I thought that it would be helpful for copilot to make the website database, so I kept it. We decided to not include admin logs, so I deleted this and then also changed a few of the PK and FK's. I downloaded the ERD as a PDF and input this into cursor so it could use it as context for the resource hub.

## Context Engineering 
- Tool: ChatGPT
- Prompt: I'm building a full-stack web application using Cursor. I'm putting together a nice bundle of context so Cursor knows what's going on. In that bundle of context (located within the context folder), there is the same project description I'm giving to you (in the shared folder), a PDF of a Figma wireframe (in the DT folder) prototype code generated by Figma Make (also in the DT folder), and a PDF of an ERD (also in the shared folder). In the shared folder, I want to have sort of a master context file. This is currently called main-context.md. I want it to be a high-level overview of the project and technical requirements as well as sort of a glossary of what all of the context files are. Can you help me come up with that?
- Outcome: ChatGPT generated a context document with a project summary, technical overview, repository layout, and descriptions of each context file. Some of the details it generated were not accurate, such as including files not in the repository, so I made a few manual changes to fix those issues. I placed the modified output in min-context.md within the "shared" folder and used it when prompting Cursor.

## Laying a Foundation
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: I am creating a Campus Resource Hub, a full-stack web application using Flask, Jinja2, Bootstrap, and SQLite. I have a basic file structure set up with context available in docs\content. See main-context.md for a project overview and glossary of the context available. See Project-Description.docx for detailed requirements. Prototype code is available in docs\context\DT\Prototype Code. For now, please familiarize yourself with the project requirements and then start setting up a basic foundation for the project. Things like the MVC architecture, a venv, and the start of the database.
- Outcome: Cursor created files for MVC, a basic app.py, and a SQLite database. It placed the database in a folder that is ingored via the gitignore, but I want the database to be included in the GitHub repo so I asked Cursor to make that change.

## Building the Browse Resources Page
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: Perfect, now let's start working on core functionality. I think the best place to start would be the Resource Listings. This would be the "Browse Resources" screen from the prototype. Please implement the following requirements for the resource listings:
  - CRUD operations for resources: title, description, images, category, location, availability rules, owner (user/team), capacity, and optional equipment lists.
  - Listing lifecycle: draft, published, archived.
  - For the visual side of things, use the AiDD-Final-Wireframes-Combined.pdf file and Prototype Code for reference.
- Outcome: Cursor implemented registration and login, the Browse Resources page including searching and filtering, and creating new resources. It included way more features than I anticipated, so I had to carefully review everything to make sure it all functions properly. Additionally, it did not style the visuals like the wireframe, instead just using default Bootstrap. I am keeping all of its work for now, but may change the visuals and need to address any issues that come up.

## Booking & Scheduling Functionality
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: That looks great! Now let's work on implementing the booking flow. Again, use the wireframe as a reference. Please follow these requirements:
  - Calendar-based booking flow with start/end time, recurrence option (optional), and conflict detection.
  - Booking approval workflow: automatic approval for open resources, staff/admin approval for restricted resources.
  - Notifications for booking confirmations and changes.
- Outcome: Cursor implemented the booking flow and staff/admin approval, but it did not implement conflict detection or notifications. I asked it to add those features.

## Conflict Detection & Notifications
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: The core of booking and scheduling seems to work great. Can you now add conflict detection and notifications? So if a user tries to book a resource that overlaps with a resource they have already booked, they should get a warning asking them if they would like to proceed with both bookings, cancel the booking they're currently trying to book, or cancel the booking they previously booked. For notifications, there should be a little notification icon next to the profile icon in the nav bar. If a user's booking is confirmed, denied, or changed, they should get a notification informing them.
- Outcome: Cursor successfully implemented conflict detection and notifications. There are some minor visual changes I would like to make, but I'm keeping Cursor's solution.

## Messaging & Dummy Data
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: That's all looking great. Now let's work on Messaging, so the basic message thread between requester and resource owner. This is included in the prototype, so be sure to reference it. The idea here is that on the details page for a resource, if a user clicks the "Contact Owner" button, it will take them to a separate "Messages" page where they can have a basic chat back and forth with the owner. Additionally, can you put in some dummy data in the database? So some resources, users, etc. Just to make it easier to test. For any dummy accounts, put the credentials somewhere I can find them so I can log in.
- Outcome: Cursor successfully implemented messaging and added dummy data to the database. I kept Cursor's solution.

## Reviews & Ratings
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: Perfect! Now let's work on reviews & ratings using this set of requirements:
  - After completed bookings, users may rate and leave feedback for resources and hosts.
  - Aggregate rating calculation and top‑rated badges.
- Outcome: Cursor's solution initally broke the resource details page, causing a TemplateSyntaxError. I asked Cursor to fix the error and it did so successfully. I kept its fixed solution.

## User Management & Authentication
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: Alright now let's get into User Management & Authentication. We already have login and registration working which is great. Now I want to double check that passwords are being stored hashed. Additionally, let's make sure that the Student, Staff, and Admin roles get different levels of access.
  - Students can view resources, request bookings, do messaging, and manage their own bookings (cancel, edit, view). Students CANNOT create or manage resources.
  - Staff can do everything students can do, and they can create resources and manage resources they have created.
  - Admins can do everything Students and Staff can do, and they also get access to an admin dashboard. Don't worry about implementing the admin dashboard for now, but do create a page for it and make sure only admins can access it.
- Outcome: Cursor verified that passwords are being hashed, and it implemented controls such that Students, Staff, and Admins have different levels of access. It also created a placeholder for the Admin dashboard. I kept its solution.

## Admin Dashboard
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: That's all looking good. Now let's move onto the admin panel. Here are the requirements for it, but also look at the prototype to see how it has been designed: Admin dashboard to manage users, resources, bookings, and moderate reviews.
- Outcome: Cursor created the admin dashboard as requested, however a lot of the data, such as users, resources, and approvals, are not displaying on it. I will have Cursor iterate on the dashboard to resolve this issue.

## Fixing Admin Dashboard
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: This is a great start! However, I'm noticing that a lot of the data is not loading on the admin panel. So the Users tab is empty, the resources tab is empty, the Reviews tab is empty, and the Approvals tab is empty when you click on it, but it has a little 3 next to the word "Approvals" in the list of tabs which implies to me that there are 3 pending approvals. However, the "Overview" tab looks like everything is loading properly and the little card things at the top seem to also have data loading correctly. Could you look into this?
- Outcome: Cursor looked into the issue and fixed the bug causing the data not to load.

## Updating the Navigation
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: Awesome, I think it's safe to say the core functionality is now fully implemented. There is a little more functionality I'd like to do, but before we get to that, I want to work on the visuals starting with the navigation. Right now, most of the pages are in the nav bar at the top. I want to make it more like the prototype where the top nav bar has the name of the site (Campus Resource Hub), the notifications, and the profile. The rest of the pages (Dashboard, Browse Resources, My Bookings, Message, My Resources, Admin Panel, and Create Resource) are all on side navigation. In short, I want to redo the navigation so it follows the prototype. I'm attaching an image of how it is in the prototype, but be sure to reference the prototype in the context folder.
- Outcome: Cursor updated the code, but introduced a bug that prevented all pages from loading. I asked it to fix this error, and it took a few iterations to get it fixed. I kept the fixed solution.

## Profile Pictures
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: Great. Now can you add uploading a profile picture as a feature? So both when the user signs up for a new account and editing their profile, they should get the option to upload a profile picutre.
- Outcome: Cursor successfully implemented uploading profile pictures and I kept its solution.

## Adding an AI Admin Assistant
- Tool: Cursor & Google AI Studio
- Prompt: A new folder has been added to your context at docs\context\shared\GEMINI_DRIVEN_WEBSITE. This is a demo of a website in which a user can write in natural language and the Google Gemini API can translate the user's request into SQL which will then pull database results, producing a human-readable output. As an example, a user could type "What were the top 3 selling products over the last year", and the site would analyze database data and produce an answer. I want to implement something similar for the Campus Resource Hub. What I'm imagining is a little chatbot on the admin dashboard that would allow admins to ask questions about usage of resources. So things like "What time of day do most resources get booked for?" I'm not totally sure about how the API key piece of this would work. I got a free API key for Google Gemini that could probably be used for this. The thing is, I want to avoid uploading my API key to the GitHub repo, but I also want to deploy this webiste on the web. Is there a way to store the API key in this project so the site can be published on the web with the chatbot being functional, while avoiding uploading my API key to GitHub?
- Outcome: Cursor used the Gemini Demo site as a reference to create a new natural language analytics assistant on the admin panel. It took multiple iterations and some experimenting with API keys to get it to work, but I kept most of the original functionality that Cursor created.

## Updating Interface for AI Assistant
- Tool: Cursor & Figma Make
- Prompt: Okay this looks great! Now I want to adjust the layout a bit. So currently, the Analytics Assistant is in an accordion at the bottom of the page. I want it to show up more like a typical chatbot. So start out as a little floating circle on the bottom right of the screen. The circle should have the the robot icon in it. Then when the user clicks on the circle, it should expand into a small-ish window still on the bottom right with the option to collapse it back down to the circle. I've attached a screenshot of an updated version of the prototype with this layout.
- Outcome: Cursor used the Figma Make interface and my description to create a more typical chatbot interface for the AI assistant. I kept its solution.
