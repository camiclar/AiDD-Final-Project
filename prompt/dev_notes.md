# Dev Notes & AI Interactions

## Creating Wireframe
- Tool: Figma Make
- Prompt summary: I gave Figma Make the Executive Summary, Core Features, and recommended database schema from the project brief.
- Outcome: Figma Make generated a wireframe that included all major features and some scaffold code. I iterated on it a few times to make design tweaks and include minor features that were initially omitted, such as profile pictures. I then exported the wireframe as a PDF and downloaded the prototype code to use as context for Cursor.

## Creating the ERD diagram
-Tool: Eraser.io
-Prompt summary: I input the recommended relational schema into eraser.io to generate the ERD diagram
-Outcome: The results included an ERD containing all the entities along with the attributes as well as the data types. While I had never seen the data types be included in ERD's I thought that it would be helpful for copilot to make the website database, so I kept it. We decided to not include admin logs, so I deleted this and then also changed a few of the PK and FK's. I downloaded the ERD as a PDF and input this into cursor so it could use it as context for the resource hub.

## Context Engineering
- Tool: ChatGPT
- Prompt: I'm building a full-stack web application using Cursor. I'm putting together a nice bundle of context so Cursor knows what's going on. In that bundle of context (located within the context folder), there is the same project description I'm giving to you (in the shared folder), a PDF of a Figma wireframe (in the DT folder) prototype code generated by Figma Make (also in the DT folder), and a PDF of an ERD (also in the shared folder). In the shared folder, I want to have sort of a master context file. This is currently called main-context.md. I want it to be a high-level overview of the project and technical requirements as well as sort of a glossary of what all of the context files are. Can you help me come up with that?
- Outcome: ChatGPT generated a context document with a project summary, technical overview, repository layout, and descriptions of each context file. Some of the details it generated were not accurate, such as including files not in the repository, so I made a few manual changes to fix those issues. I placed the modified output in min-context.md within the "shared" folder and used it when prompting Cursor.

## Laying a Foundation
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: I am creating a Campus Resource Hub, a full-stack web application using Flask, Jinja2, Bootstrap, and SQLite. I have a basic file structure set up with context available in docs\content. See main-context.md for a project overview and glossary of the context available. See Project-Description.docx for detailed requirements. Prototype code is available in docs\context\DT\Prototype Code. For now, please familiarize yourself with the project requirements and then start setting up a basic foundation for the project. Things like the MVC architecture, a venv, and the start of the database.
- Outcome: Cursor created files for MVC, a basic app.py, and a SQLite database. It placed the database in a folder that is ingored via the gitignore, but I want the database to be included in the GitHub repo so I asked Cursor to make that change.
