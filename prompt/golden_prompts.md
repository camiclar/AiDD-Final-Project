## Building the Browse Resources Page
- Tool: Cursor
- Prompt: Perfect, now let's start working on core functionality. I think the best place to start would be the Resource Listings. This would be the "Browse Resources" screen from the prototype. Please implement the following requirements for the resource listings:
  - CRUD operations for resources: title, description, images, category, location, availability rules, owner (user/team), capacity, and optional equipment lists.
  - Listing lifecycle: draft, published, archived.
  - For the visual side of things, use the AiDD-Final-Wireframes-Combined.pdf file and Prototype Code for reference.
- Outcome: Cursor implemented registration and login, the Browse Resources page including searching and filtering, and creating new resources. It included way more features than I anticipated, so I had to carefully review everything to make sure it all functions properly. Additionally, it did not style the visuals like the wireframe, instead just using default Bootstrap. I am keeping all of its work for now, but may change the visuals and need to address any issues that come up.
